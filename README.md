## BDD
INPUT: the user inputs his or her birhday date in terms of year, month and day

OUTPUT: the user gets back his or her akan name

HOW IT WORKS: the javascript functions in the backend use a predetermined algorithm to get user's akan name based on birthday date and gender.

ERROR: an error message is displayed if user input is not a number or if day of month inputted exceeds 31.

## technologies used
html: for basic webpage structure

css: for styling the webpage

javascript: provides algorithm for backend calculations
